# ===== Frontend =====
# In the single-service deploy, frontend calls /api on the same origin,
# so you usually do NOT need to set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL.
# Set this only if you deploy backend separately.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api

# If you deploy backend separately and want Next.js rewrites in dev/prod,
# set API_SERVER_URL to that backend origin (e.g. https://your-api.onrender.com)
